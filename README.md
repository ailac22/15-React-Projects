# React 15 project practice

Redoing of the 'Code 15 React Projects' video from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo) for the sake of React and CSS practice.

Different techniques and frameworks from the ones in the videos have been used, such as [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
